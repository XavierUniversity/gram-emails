##Master Email Template

The master email template is based off of the [Ferio Email Template](http://themeforest.net/item/ferio-responsive-email-mailbuild-online/11945346) which 
was purchased for use by all Xavier University e-mail communications.

*This template is to be a starting point for all official university communications.*
